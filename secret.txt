Project Name: Darasa Reports

What is it? Darasa Reports is a digital tool that helps schools 
in Africa keep track of their students' information and grades.

Think of it like: A digital version of a student's report card, 
but instead of just showing grades, it also stores other important information about the student.

What does it do?

- Helps teachers and administrators keep track of student grades and progress
- Stores important student information in one place
- Makes it easy to share information with parents and other teachers

Why is it important? Darasa Reports helps schools in Africa to:

- Improve student outcomes by making it easier for teachers to track progress
- Save time by reducing paperwork and administrative tasks
- Enhance collaboration among teachers and administrators

What needs to be done? We need to build a website that introduces Darasa Reports 
to the world, explains how it works, and shows its benefits. This website will 
be like a digital brochure that tells people about the product and encourages them to try it out.

Goals:

- Create a website that is easy to understand and navigate
- Showcase the features and benefits of Darasa Reports
- Encourage visitors to sign up for a demo or learn more about the product
